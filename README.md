This is a conceptual project I made for a web service class.
This is a Hotel Mangement System that uses REST and SOAP services.
It uses HTTP protocols such as get, post, put and delete to carry various methods.
It has a SOAP protocol that returns the available rooms in the arrayList.
This is conceptual, therefore, many more methods can be implemented, a ui can be implemented, a database can be used, etc.
